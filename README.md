# codebar-intro-to-aws

This repository accompanies a virtual event run for Codebar. It serves as an example of
an application that has been build using AWS Application Composer, to demonstrate the drag-and-drop
capabilities that the service offers.

## Deploying

To deploy this application, the AWS SAM CLI tool is recommended. The [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-deploying.html#serverless-sam-cli-using-package-and-deploy)
provides all the details required for this.
